# VLDB2020: Workshops

## September 4, 2020

* (International Workshop on Very Large Internet of Things (VLIoT 2020))[https://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~groppe/vliot/] (<a class="badge badge-secondary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#VLIoT2020">Detail...</a>)

An increasing number of real-world objects are becoming accessible and manageable through the Internet. According to Statista, the number of these devices is approximately 30 billion by 2020, forming a very large Internet of Things (VLIoT). This massive number of "smart" objects will cooperate with each other, have their own metadata, and may continuously produce new data (in form of events, sensor data, or actuator states). Data management will be a major challenge in the very large Internet of Things. Hence, efficient IoT infrastructure and technologies must be developed to handle masses of IoT data with high performance. This will include: new techniques to filter and store relevant data; efficient replication approaches for objects with constrained resources in order to increase availability and durability; new protocols for voting about decisions among objects; and smooth integration of heterogeneous objects.
 
The goal of this workshop is to bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners working in the field of IoT and to allow them to report and exchange their findings addressing these challenges. This workshop also intends to discuss other closely-related technologies such as Nanotechnology, Fog-, Edge-, and Dew-Computing for IoT. The ideas of Fog, Edge and Dew Computing may indeed solve or attenuate the problems of a very large Internet of Things (w.r.t. performance, energy-efficiency, as well as security and privacy aspects).
