# VLDB2020: Call for Workshops

## Information

VLDB 2020 invites submissions for workshop proposals on all topics covered by the conference. Workshop proposals that advance the field of data management to new directions are specially encouraged. VLDB workshops may be half-day or full-day events. They will take place either on the day before or the day after the main VLDB conference (i.e., on Monday, August 31 or Friday, September 4 in 2020).
All VLDB 2020 workshops will be "serviced", meaning that logistics such as registration, catering, room allocation, and audio-visual arrangements will be handled by the VLDB conference organizers. The workshop organizers are responsible for defining the technical program and the format for their workshops.

## Important Dates

* Submission deadline: **January 10, 2020 (5 p.m. PST)**
* Notification: **February 2, 2020**

## Submission Guidelines

Workshop proposals should be submitted via e-mail (**[vldb2020-workshops@googlegroups.com](vldb2020-workshops@googlegroups.com)**) to VLDB 2020 workshops co-chairs, Wook-Shin Han, Makoto Onizuka, and Nesime Tatbul with "**VLDB 2020 Workshop Proposal**" in the e-mail subject. Workshop organizers with special requirements should contact the workshops co-chairs as soon as possible; such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Proposals must be in pdf, **not exceeding 8 pages**, and including the following (in the order given):
* workshop title
* chairs and organizers
* contact information
* a description of the workshop's topic and its goals
* a statement on how the workshop complements or relates to other events
* desired workshop format, including preferred date and duration
* a description of the submission review process, including key dates and coverage of how conflicts of interest are handled
* a brief statement on diversity commitment
* plans for publicity
* plans for disseminating the results of the workshop (e.g., proceedings details, any additional opportunities for further dissemination such as special journal issues)
* potential (or accepted) program committee members
* potential (or accepted) invited talks, keynotes, tutorials, or panels
* plans for seeking sponsorship, if any
* historical information about each of the most recent previous editions of the workshop (if this is not its first edition), including:
    * date, venue, and affiliated event
    * number of submitted and accepted papers
    * number of participants

Proposal evaluation criteria include relevance to VLDB, scientific quality, quality of proposed organization, evidence of interest (e.g., previous submission and attendance counts), long-term vision, diversity considerations (of all forms including, e.g., affiliation, geography, gender, race, seniority, etc.), and difference from other proposals.

## Additional Information

Accepted workshops will be scheduled considering the preferred date and duration, the workshop topics, and the number of available slots.
The organizers of accepted workshops are required to announce the workshop and call for papers, solicit submissions, conduct the review process, compose a workshop program, and organize the proceedings. Workshop programs must comply with a joint catering schedule, and workshop programs must be published 15 days prior to the early registration deadline for VLDB 2020.
