# VLDB2020: Call for Contributions - Panels

## Information

Panels provide a unique forum to debate different points of view concerning big issues that face our community. For a panel to be successful, the setting must be debate-oriented with panelists advocating sharply different points of view and not simply a sequence of short presentations. The focus of the panel must also be a topic of important to the entire community or a broad section of the community. We invite panel proposals for VLDB 2020 (duration: 90 minutes) that satisfy the above criteria. The proposal should be submitted by the moderator of the panel. It must specify the topic of the panel and explain its significance to the community. It needs to clearly articulate the opposing views that will be debated in the panel and the questions the panelists will be expected to respond to. The list of panelists who have agreed to participate in the conference should be provided. Kindly include the affiliation as well as a short bio (or the URL of the web page) for the moderator and the panelists.
